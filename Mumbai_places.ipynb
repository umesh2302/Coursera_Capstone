    "### Back ground and Problem set : \n",
    "##### •\tOur international fund house wants to invest into booming real estate industry (in commercial /shop) of India’s Financial Capital Mumbai . They want to purchase some commercial property and lease it out to get good lease rental and wants to reduce the roll over risk. \n",
    "##### •\t(A rollover risk is when your earlier lease is expired, and you are unable to lease it out at same /higher lease rate to new client)\n",
    "##### •\tHowever, they are not sure which part of city, they should invest in and which type of shop/commercial category they should select . \n",
    "### Solution logic : \n",
    "##### •\tTypically , an area where most of shopping / commercial outlets are located , suggests that it has more commercial activities in and around that area. \n",
    "##### •Further, if customers have given more positive feedbacks of outlets in that area , means those outlets /area are very famous and are likely to fetch good lease rental with minimum roll over risk. \n",
    "### Approach : \n",
    "##### •\tWe can demarcate Mumbai area on the basis of pin codes and then using Foursquare API can identify which area has maximum stores/venues located within 500 meters of radius. \n",
    "##### •\tFurther, we can fine tune our results based on highest rating views/stores  for  top 5 locations \n",
    "##### •\tWe can further , shortlist type of store/venue for top 5 locations based on popularity index of each type of store. \n"
